# Forest-Fire-Detection
## A tool to detect fire from videos and images

### Description:-
1. The objective of this project is to identify fire incidents through visual analysis.
2. By selectively unfreezing certain layers, a pre-trained Inception CNN architecture is retrained for improved performance.
3. Diverse feature extraction techniques are employed on the data to enhance the analysis process.

# Instructions
1. 'image_capture.py' is a script that utilizes a webcam to extract individual frames from a video feed.
2. The 'ForestFireDetection.ipynb' code is designed to analyze both images and videos for forest fire detection.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the 'ForestFireDetection.ipynb' file.
4. Run each code block in the file in a sequential order.
